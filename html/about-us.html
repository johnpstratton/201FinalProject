    <p>I’m entering the software development industry with a background in education and leadership. My colleagues and friends tell me I’m very diplomatic and can find common ground in almost any area of disagreement. With a strong desire to positively affect the lives of others and approach challenges systematically, I am hoping to find a position that allows me to work collaboratively with a software development team in order to produce a user-friendly product.</p>

    <p>I grew up in the midwest, largely homeschooled which fostered an abiding curiosity about life, sciences, philosophy and myriad of things in between. I've spent the last 10 years in the hospitality industry with brief forays into business management and sales. Hospitality was great in that it helped me overcome a lot of my social anxiety and awkwardness but eventually I realized that it was draining me because I couldn't feed my passion for understanding things and exploring new ideas. After some self-reflection and research, I began to see software development as the perfect arena in which to indulge my curiosity and love of learning regardless of the broad scope of my interests. My goal is to connect with creative people on an experimental technologies team with a strong focus on eliminating socio-economic barriers and fostering a sense of global community. One of my instructors told me I had a really strong grasp of conceptual relationships and I believe that combined with my sense of wonder strengthens my ability to develop adaptive programs and bridge the gap between seemingly disparate approaches to a challenge.</p>

    <p>Before deciding to change careers, I was serving in the Army as a Senior Training Manager for an organization of 750 people. 
      I decided to learn Software Development to have a good understanding of what is going on underneath the hood of any company's software/applications is incredibly pertinent to being successful in a new organization. 
      I enjoy the technical challenges that software development provides me and the opportunity to positively impact thousands of peoples' lives.
      I would ideally use this skillset in a tech company as a junior developer with a focus on becoming a full-stack/senior developer
     I have a lot of experience working as part of a team under very high-pressure situations and I am excited to bring that experience to collaborate as a development team.</p>
