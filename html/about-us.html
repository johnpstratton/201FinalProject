    <p>I’m entering the software development industry with a background in education and leadership. My colleagues and friends tell me I’m very diplomatic and can find common ground in almost any area of disagreement. With a strong desire to positively affect the lives of others and approach challenges systematically, I am hoping to find a position that allows me to work collaboratively with a software development team in order to produce a user-friendly product.</p>

    <p>I've spent the last 10 years in the hospitality industry with brief forays into business management and sales. Working in hospitality helped me overcome a lot of social anxiety and awkwardness, but after doing some research and self-reflection over the last few years I began to see software development as the perfect arena to indulge my curiosity and the broad scope of my interests in a tangible way. One of my instructors told me I had a really strong grasp of conceptual relationships; I believe that coupled with my sense of wonder, this strengthens my ability to develop adaptive programs and bridge the gap between seemingly disparate approaches to a challenge. My goal is to connect with creative people on an experimental technologies team that has a strong focus on shattering socio-economic barriers, and fostering a sense of global community. </p>

    <p>Before deciding to change careers, I was serving in the Army as a Senior Training Manager for an organization of 750 people. 
      I decided to learn Software Development to have a good understanding of what is going on underneath the hood of any company's software/applications is incredibly pertinent to being successful in a new organization. 
      I enjoy the technical challenges that software development provides me and the opportunity to positively impact thousands of peoples' lives.
      I would ideally use this skillset in a tech company as a junior developer with a focus on becoming a full-stack/senior developer
     I have a lot of experience working as part of a team under very high-pressure situations and I am excited to bring that experience to collaborate as a development team.</p>
